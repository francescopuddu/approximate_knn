# Scalable Approximate KNN for Latent Graph Learning

## Abstract
The field of Latent Graph Learning addresses problems
where learning an implicit graph over the input data can
help tackle the task more effectively. During the graph creation process, the standard approach leverages a pair-wise
distance matrix, which results in a scalability issue given
its quadratic cost. In this paper, we illustrate the problem by analysing some significant works from the field, and
then present our proposed solution. We develop an efficient
approximate KNN algorithm that leverages a hierarchical
data structure, and compare it to the naive approach in
terms of graph quality, time-space complexity, and training performance. We show that we significantly outperform
standard solutions in memory efficiency.
